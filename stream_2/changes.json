        "translated": "Delhi is the capital of India. Its old name was Indraprastha. Pandavas built it. There are many tourist places in Delhi. The fort, Qutub Minar, and the old fort are historical places. There are also many big bazaars here. Delhi is full of life. There are also problems with facilities in Delhi. Due to heavy traffic, there are often delays. In summer, water and electricity shortages occur."
