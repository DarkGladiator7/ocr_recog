        "translated": "Delhi is the capital of India. Its old name was Indraprastha. The Pandavas built it. There are many tourist places in Delhi. The fort, Qutub Minar, and the old fort are historical places. There are also many big bazaars here. Delhi is full of life. If there are facilities in Delhi, then there are also problems. Due to a large population, it becomes difficult. In summer, water and electricity shortages occur."
