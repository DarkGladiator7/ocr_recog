        "translated": "The fruit and vegetable market\n\nIn this picture, I see a fruit and vegetable market. The market is located in the center of the city, near the main road. There are many types of fruits and vegetables, including tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers, onions, garlic, lemons, limes, eggplants, potatoes, carrots, beets, radishes, and celery.\n\nPeople buy fruits and vegetables from the market, and they also buy other items such as bread, milk, and eggs. The market is very busy, with many people buying and selling goods. The prices are reasonable, and the quality of the produce is good. The market is also clean and well-organized.\n\nThe market is a popular place for people to shop, and it is located near a bus stop."
